# AWS Weather ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **ETL pipeline** for managing and analyzing weather data using AWS services. The pipeline efficiently collects, catalogs, queries, and secures weather datasets, enabling seamless data processing and insights.

## Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following key components:

### 1️⃣ Data Crawling
- **Service:** AWS Glue
- **Process:**
  - AWS Glue crawlers scan weather datasets stored in **Amazon S3**.
  - A **Data Catalog** is created to enable structured querying and easy data organization.

### 2️⃣ Querying with Athena
- **Service:** Amazon Athena
- **Process:**
  - Queries are executed directly on the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
  - Supports on-demand analysis without requiring a database setup.

### 3️⃣ Automation with CloudFormation
- **Service:** AWS CloudFormation
- **Process:**
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach to automate AWS Glue crawlers and resources.
  - Ensures repeatability and reduces manual setup effort.

### 4️⃣ Secure Access Management
- **Service:** AWS IAM
- **Process:**
  - IAM roles and policies manage user permissions and ensure secure access.
  - Prevents unauthorized access and maintains data integrity.

### 5️⃣ Data Insights
- **Structured Data:** The cataloged data allows for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Insights Gained:**
  - Identified weather patterns and trends.
  - Potential applications in **climate studies, disaster prediction, and environmental monitoring**.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Glue** (Crawlers, Data Catalog, ETL processing)
- **Amazon S3** (Data Storage)
- **Amazon Athena** (Querying and Analysis)
- **AWS CloudFormation** (Infrastructure Automation)
- **AWS IAM** (Access Control and Security)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-weather-etl.git
   cd aws-weather-etl
   ```
2. Deploy AWS CloudFormation stack:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name WeatherETLStack
   ```
3. Run AWS Glue Crawler:
   - Navigate to the **AWS Glue console**.
   - Start the crawler to scan the weather dataset in **Amazon S3**.
4. Query Data using Athena:
   - Open **Amazon Athena**.
   - Select the Glue Data Catalog and execute SQL queries on the dataset.
5. Secure Access:
   - Ensure appropriate IAM roles are assigned to team members.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data ingestion with AWS Lambda.
- Integrate with AWS QuickSight for real-time visualization.
- Add machine learning models for weather prediction.
